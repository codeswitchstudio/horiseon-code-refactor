# Bootcamp Challenge 1: Horiseon Code Refactor

## Objective
The objective of this project is to use the existing bootcamp starter code and refactor it to make a website that looks the same but is more accessible.


## Challenges Met:  

### 1. Acceptance Criteria 

The website now meets accessibility standards by fulfilling the criteria below:

#### Semantic HTML elements can now be found throughout the source code. 

- Instead of all divs, the site now semantic tags such as header, main, article, section, and footer tags

#### HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

- There is now a structure with the things on top such as headers and navs going all the way down to the footer in a logica order

#### Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes

- All images and icons now have descriptive alt texts except the decorative hero background image inside article element in css stylesheet. For this I referred to [w3schools's page on Accessibility Meaningful & Decorative Images](https://www.w3schools.com/accessibility/accessibility_meaningful_images.php).

#### Heading attributes fall in sequential order

- Instead of a recurring h2 tag in the footer has now been renamed to h4

#### Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

- The titles correspond to the function of their content


### 2. Other challenges: The Scout Rule aka Always leave code cleaner than the state you found it

- All links are functioning correctly now - the top one missed the first anchor to SEO
- Reworked the CSS to make it more efficient consolidating code, removing repetitive code, or reordering them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements as the aside code was ahead of the main
- Placed comments before major sections of the page.

So the page looks the same but everything has been tidied in the code
